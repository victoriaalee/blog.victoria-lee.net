<ol>
<li><strong>Thanksgiving and Christmas meals.</strong> Good food with good company, aka my family. &lt;3</li>
<li><strong>Xian Sushi and Noodle, a cheesy Valentine's Day cake, a Houston art museum, the non-sunset at Galveston.</strong> And the person with whom I experienced these things (and more).<center><img class="alignnone wp-image-276 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/IMG_96021-e1480020210531-300x225.jpg" alt="img_96021" width="300" height="225" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-277 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/IMG_96031-e1480020245761-300x225.jpg" alt="img_96031" width="300" height="225" /></center></li>
<li><strong>Long conversations over milk tea.</strong> And the two friends willing to have them with me.
<ol>
<li>Aaron – From drowning out sorrows (mostly mine) after OS quizzes at Tap House to drowning out sorrows in general (also mostly mine) at KF Tea.</li>
<li>Austin – Thankful for that first conversation at Teapioca Lounge this past January and how our friendship has evolved since then.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/austin.png" alt="austin" width="1026" height="314" /></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><img class="wp-image-286 size-medium alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/IMG_95541-169x300.jpg" alt="img_95541" width="169" height="300" />Kyubey plush.</strong> Waking up in the middle of the night to a cute but slightly creepy creature asking me if I want to be a magic girl.... Everyone go watch Madoka NOW.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.texas4000.org/">Texas 4000</a>. </strong>Thankful for an amazing non-profit dedicated to fighting cancer and incredibly excited to be a part of the team to complete a bike ride from Austin to Anchorage, Alaska in Summer 2018.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/programs-centers/cancer-prevention-research-training-program.html">MD Anderson’s Cancer Prevention Research Training Program</a>.</strong> The 24 other people in the program, my mentors and peers in the lab, and the physicians I had the opportunity to shadow made my three-month experience in Houston unforgettable.<img class="size-full wp-image-293 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/IMG_97601.jpg" alt="img_97601" width="960" height="720" /></li>

<ol>
<li>Annabel, Lina, Kennedy – best tour group ever!</li>
<li>Christina, Ruchika, Iris – my awesome roommates</li>
<li>Everyone under 21 who had a dance party in the house of the palm reader we visited together and the amusing debrief afterward</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The opportunity to serve as Outreach then Corporate Chair with officer teams composed of amazing and inspiring people</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Torchy's Tacos.</strong> And catching up with The Nerd Herd at the beginning of the summer.<img class="size-full wp-image-296 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/IMG_97611.jpg" alt="img_97611" width="960" height="540" /></li>
<li><strong>Brandon, finally switching over to ECE. </strong>In other words, I’m happy that he’s finally where he belongs, even if it means that I’ve been left all alone in my BME classes. Who am I supposed to stay up late with eating gummy bears and hearing their jokes about how pchem is the low-level end of chemistry?</li>
<li><strong><img class="wp-image-266 size-medium alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/11/12200638_10203704480332779_1614213431_n-225x300.jpg" alt="12200638_10203704480332779_1614213431_n" width="225" height="300" />Semaphore. </strong>Here’s to at least 1.5 more years of debugging CS class projects.</li>
<li><strong>Music. </strong>Some new tunes that keep me going during study sessions.
<ol>
<li>Red Velvet's "Russian Roulette"</li>
<li>Black Pink's "BOOMBAYAH", "Whistle", and "Playing with Fire"</li>
<li>Porter Robinson &amp; Madeon’s "Shelter"</li>
<li>Katy Perry’s "Rise"</li>
<li>Shakira’s "Try Everything"</li>
<li>Taeyeon’s "Why"</li>
<li>G.E.M.’s 新的心跳 ("New Heartbeat")</li>
<li>Faye Wong’s 紅豆 ("Red Bean")</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Taco Joint.</strong> Providing sustenance to me when I’m crying in the engineering area. Seriously, I go here at least once a week. Their potato, egg, and cheese tacos are the bomb.</li>
</ol>

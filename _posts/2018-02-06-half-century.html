<p>This past Saturday, our team had our half century test - 50 miles in under 5 hours.</p>
<p>The week before, we had done essentially the same route minus 1.5 miles. My ride group at the time had finished that in about four hours, so I thought that I was in pretty good shape for this test. I ate pasta the night before, slept for almost 8 hours, and made sure to eat some oatmeal for breakfast before leaving my apartment. On the bike, I took extra care to keep drinking water and eating food. Despite getting a flat and having to call SAG for a rider who unfortunately had knee pain, I felt incredibly optimistic during the first part of the ride.</p>
<p>However, when we hit the rest stop, we realized that we were cutting it incredibly close on time. We had 22 miles left to be biked in about 2 hours and 15 minutes. I'm pretty sure we didn't even spend 5 minutes at the rest stop because I only had the chance to eat one doughnut hole and grab some Clif Bar products to go!</p>
<p>Once we got back on the road, we were hit with a headwind. Our group tried to consistently switch out who was leading, but in the end we fell into one formation for most of the way back once I started gapping on every uphill and needed to be drafting behind someone. I told myself that I'd keep pushing because we couldn't stop; there was no time. I was going to be okay.</p>
<p>But it became increasingly apparent that I was not going to be okay.</p>
<p>While I was on the bike that day, I tried to remember that no matter where I cycled to, I would always carry my family and friends in my heart (as cheesy as it sounds), but it wasn't actually them that allowed me to push myself on the way back. I had woken up that morning to a short encouraging message from a 2017 rider, and it was this message that popped into my mind right as I felt like I would not be able to go even one more mile.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Just remember, you can stop but you can’t quit".</p></blockquote>
<p>When our group stopped at a red light, I turned and told them that we had to pull over and let me eat something. I ended up taking two strangely delicious orange-flavored Clif Bar Shot Bloks (gummies with electrolytes, sugar, and caffeine).</p>
<p>As we made it back to familiar territory about 3 miles out from campus, a strange sense of calm settled over me. I told myself that no matter what the result, I had pushed myself today, and I could only improve from here.</p>
<p>We made it with 3 minutes to spare.</p>

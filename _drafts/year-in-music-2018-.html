<p>In 2018, I spent 35% more time listening to music, likely due to spending nearly 8 hours a day at my laptop with my earbuds in starting mid-September.</p>
<p>2017 was definitely just the beginning of my shift from kpop to cpop; this year's top songs consist of four in Mandarin, one in Japanese, and none in Korean. As for top artists, Diana Wang, Mayday, and Taeyeon remain. I'm not too surprised by Mayday and Taeyeon because they are among my favorite artists of all time, but I'm a little surprised by Diana Wang. A strong newcomer to the list is 王艷薇 as my #1 artist in 2018 with a total of 56 hours listening to her music, most of which was probably 無色憂傷 ("Beautiful Sadness") and 天使輕吻過的聲音 ("Angel's Voice") which appear in my top songs list.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, my top genre was pop. Apparently I listen to non-mainstream artists 98% more than the average Spotify listener. Shoutout to the fact that I don't really listen to many American songs. This year I also made a more conscious effort to listen to new music. I don't have the statistic for 2017, but compared to 2016 I listened to about 3-4 times more unique tracks for a total of 4,078.</p>
<hr />
<h3>日本語を勉強しましょうか</h3>
<p>According to Spotify, I kicked off the year listening to "Closer" by Oh My Girl, but the first new tracks I discovered were based off of a RADWIMPS Spotify radio station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenshi Yonezu - "Orion"</li>
<li>Kenshi Yonezu - 灰色と青 ("Gray and Blue")</li>
<li>Mrs. GREEN APPLE - "Wanted! Wanted!"</li>
<li>[Alexandros] - "Moon Song"</li>
<li>KANA-BOON - ないものねだり</li>
</ul>
<p>I only stayed on my Japanese studying grind until school started back up in mid-January and I became busy with schoolwork and T4K, but I did find a few more songs from my Discover Weekly.</p>
<ul>
<li>ONE OK ROCK - "Listen"</li>
<li>Linda Liao - 愛喔愛 ("Love Oh Love")</li>
<li>Heyo &amp; Jill Vidal - 盛夏的舞 by Heyo &amp; Jill Vidal</li>
</ul>
<p>I mainly listened to these eight songs for a while, and now when I listen to these songs, I specifically think of listening to these songs on the bus ride back to my apartment from jazz appreciation in the stadium.</p>
<hr />
<h3>April showers bring May flowers</h3>
<p>One day as I was walking to my jazz appreciation class (a significant 20 minute walk to the stadium from my apartment in West Campus) I was listening to my Discover Weekly and listened to "Moments" for the second time. The first time that I had heard it, I thought that it was okay, but I didn't save it to my Spotify library because it was just a single. But then I saw that this time it was linked to a full album by Mitis, so I listened to the whole album and really liked it! But it was "Moments" that I absolutely loved.</p>
<blockquote><p>These are the moments.</p>
<p>They keep me going.</p>
<p>We lie in the silence.</p>
<p>We keep our hearts open.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was these lyrics that really pushed me through a lot of hard moments through my century test and the hard moments of the summer ride.</p>
<p>As I was wrapping up final projects and exams. I discovered the song "who cares!" by Sundial and "I Love The Sky" by Priscilla Abby, both of which have very relatable vibes. Girls' Generation's Hyoyeon released a solo "Sober", which was incredibly catchy. For our ride year recap video, "The Best Thing" by Seizo &amp; Púr Múdd was featured.</p>
<p>[I love the sky music video]</p>
<p>I also had a few songs recommended to me. 病變 (female version with 鞠文嫻 &amp; Deepain). The simple yet beautiful piano background combined with the singing and rap. 打上花火 ("Fireworks") by Daoko &amp; Kenshi Yonezu, also the piano beginning. Li Yugang's 剛好遇見你 ("Happened to Meet You") and I was obsessed. I felt the song to be particularly fitting in the context of being about to graduate and having friends moving to different places and not knowing whether those friendships will continue but knowing that we will continue to cherish them.</p>
<p>May was also the beginning of some upheavals in my romantic relationships, so I found myself repeating 所謂的愛 ("So-called Love") by Xiao Yu and 我們分開應該會更好一點 ("Being Apart Should Be Better") by FS (Fuying &amp; Sam).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Alaska</h3>
<p>One of the first defining songs of the summer to me was "Cut to the Feeling" by Carly Rae Jepsen, which was a favorite song of my teammate Katie. When I listen to this song, I am transported back to the mountains of Death Valley as our trailer van struggled on the slopes in the heat while Sam and I jammed to this song and other pop music instead of the usual hip hop fare.</p>
<p>A next moment of music among the cycling was in Portland. My now boyfriend showed me "Love Scenario" by iKON. I remember the exact moment I listened to the song first. I was in my sleeping bag on the floor of my host family's study with a stupid grin on my face.</p>
<p>"Crazy Kids" which reminds me our bike ride to 100 Mile House when my teammate Taylor was quoting the Kesha description tracks.</p>
<p>On Day 60, we met up with the rest of the routes, and their theme songs of the summer were adopted into mine. "Superlove" reminds me of T4K despite not being on Rockies, the route which actually had a whole choreographed routine to it. "Wavin' Flag" also reminds me of T4K despite not being on Ozarks.</p>
<hr />
<h3>In limbo</h3>
<p>I listened to G.E.M.'s 倒數 ("Countdown") and fell in love with the music video.</p>
<p>[Countdown]</p>
<p>I also loved her 另一個童話 ("A Different Fairy Tale"). At first I wasn't a big fan of the song itself but then I looked up the lyrics and realized that I really liked the message about living a different story than behaving and living the typical one.</p>
<p>And then now that I wasn't on the road anymore, I listened to Blackpink's Square Up album. "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" is so catchy, but my favorites are "Forever Young" (love the sound) and "See U Later" (love the message).</p>
<p>I also listened to Vickeblanka's "Walk", which was the ending theme song of "Flavors of Youth", which I watched "with" Louis (as in at the same time in our respective homes).</p>
<p>And finally I discovered 飄向北方 ("Stranger in the North")</p>
<hr />
<h3>Autumn commutes</h3>
<p>I started work in September. One day while my Discover Weekly was playing in the background, I suddenly noticed a really beautiful song. It turned out to be Calculasian's cover of 夜空中最亮的星 ("Brightest Star in the Night Sky"). It sounded very familiar to me, so I searched in Spotify and found out I had actually listened to the song before in a version by 楊曉, whose album I had listened to earlier in the week. I started listening to her version on repeat because of it's piano, but then I discovered Priscilla Abby's EDM cover and it's cute music video! [insert music video]</p>
<p>After noticing 夜空中最亮的星, I re-listened to 楊曉's album and realized that I liked 不好意思寂寞 ("Sorry for Being Lonely") and 曉得 ("Understand") because it fed into my angst with relationship stuff. I also liked 鏗鏘玫瑰 ("Steel Roses") which was the song after 夜空中最亮的星 in the album so maybe I liked it because I kept on listening to it.</p>
<p>I also discovered 王艷薇's  album 框不住的艷薇 and I ended up liking 框不住的愛 ("Unlimited Love") and the two tracks I mentioned above in my top tracks. These songs by 楊曉 and 王艷薇 in particular remind me of many a commute for the first month and a half in my job.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Get away out of my face</h3>
<p>As work ramped up and friendships strained, I started listening to songs that helped me through the struggles, particularly focused around empowering myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Siren" by Sunmi</li>
<li>"Don't Panic" by Shi Shi</li>
<li>"100%" by Kisum</li>
<li>沉睡的巨人 ("Sleeping Titan") by Aaron Yan because I really like the message. I was starting to feel pretty challenged by work at this point, and I would listen to this for motivation while debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Sleeping Titan]</p>
<p>Daydreaming by 張粹方</p>
<p>Finally, "Burn" by Priscilla Abby because I missed Louis and listened to our shared playlist and liked the song a lot better than the first times I had listened to it.</p>
<p>[Burn]</p>
<hr />
<h3>Obsessions: Victoria moods, cantopop comebacks</h3>
<p>The last two months of 2018 was characterized by series of quick obsessions.</p>
<p>While looking into extracurriculars to combat the feeling of wasting away my time after work, I found a kpop dance class for "Hellevator" by Stray Kids, decided to listen to the song, and instantly became obsessed! I ended up not going to that class but instead joining a series where we ended up covering BTS "Idol", which I did not particularly like when I had first listened to the song but signed up anyway to fulfill by high school kpop dreams. It was at one of these classes that I discovered "Solo" by Jennie because they put it on during the warm-up.</p>
<p>Besides kpop, I finally listened to R-Chord's 要你知道 album after having seen various tracks pop up in my Discover Weekly since back in spring. I loved the whole album but especially 不愛也是愛我 ("Not Loving is Loving") [insert music video]</p>
<p>The end of the year also meant time for TVB's high-budget dramas. This year's dramas hooked me in with a couple of theme songs: 無畏的肩膊 by Fred Cheng from the very wholesome drama 跳躍生命線 ("Life on the Line") and 別再怕 ("Don't Be Afraid Anymore") by Hana Kuk from 兄弟 ("Fist Fight"). They use it so well in the drama for this really cute couple.</p>
<p>Phil Lam's A Touch Of album. Love 榮辱戰爭 ("War of Honor") , 生之頌 ("Miracle") 沒有你還沒有你 ("Without You")</p>
<p>我一直在這裡 ("I've Always Been Here") by 李玉剛 because of the piano accompaniment</p>
<p>是什麼讓我遇見這樣的你 ("What Allowed Me to Meet Someone Like You") by Ann Bai because of the lyric about being dust in the universe and how I now think that we're all specks in the universe and nothing matters.</p>

<p>At this point, I have honestly lost track of the number of blogs that I have had over the years.</p>
<p>What compels me to periodically remake them? Perhaps I will never know. Regardless, the cycle continues. It is a new year. I’m still procrastinating (surprise) as I meant to move my blog back onto WordPress from Tumblr [link] on the first day of the year.</p>
<p>Nothing much is going to change here. I’m probably just going to continue posting about my arguably boring life and random bits of thought, but hopefully on a more regular basis. I used to be really ambitious about posting on my blogs, setting an unattainable goal of writing something insightful daily. Who has time for daily insight? I don’t.</p>
<p>I kid, I kid. It’s just too much of a strain amidst trying to get good grades and also dealing with this thing called sleep that always gets in the way. Aiya. Most of my blogs began to collect metaphorical dust within half a year’s time because I would simply tell myself that I didn’t have time to think of something insightful that day, so I’d push it off to the next day, upon which I’d have to come up with something doubly insightful. And well, here we are. I guess what I’m saying is that quality is going down the drain, not that I had any to begin with.</p>
<p>I guess I still try to be [ambitious] in an attempt to live up to the email address that I created in seventh grade and still use unironically in everyday life (minus career-related goings), ambitious.victorialee, which, if you noticed, is also my site tagline. Oh, I could go on and on about how my youthful ambitions are all gone now, but I’ll leave that for another post when it isn’t 12:40 in the morning. Granted, this is actually a pretty early time to be sleeping by my previous self’s standards. I did find myself a new site layout that has a nice picture of the ocean. I found it fitting, even though the ocean isn’t exactly a river….</p>
<p>Is it some attempt at trying to hide my horrendous pieces of writing? Or is it just like when it is time to start a new journal, cast aside the old Disney princess styled journals that I owned in the good old days.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the start of my fourth semester at UT Austin. I am registered for six classes and one pass/fail seminar right now.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>BME 113L</strong>: Intro to Numerical Methods (MATLAB)</li>
<li><strong>BME 335</strong>: Engineering Probability &amp; Statistics</li>
<li><strong>BME 344</strong>: Biomechanics</li>
<li><strong>CS 363D</strong>: Intro to Data Mining</li>
<li><strong>CS 371P</strong>: Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li><strong>JPN 601D</strong>: Japanese I</li>
<li><strong>NSC 110H</strong>: Natural Sciences Honors Seminar</li>
</ol>

<p>I hesitate to say that I am looking forward to going back to school because of a couple reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Waking up at 8 am.</strong> I probably ruined my sleep schedule over the break because I always turned off the alarm that I set at 8 am and continued to sleep until 11 am.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing with the stress of school.</strong> Unavoidable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall though, I am excited to learn a lot in my classes this semester. I am mainly excited about the following classes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>BME 335.</strong> I took SDS 321 (Introduction to Probability &amp; Statistics) to satisfy a requirement for my CS degree, and I was initially hoping to get credit for BME 335 through that class. However, the professor, who is actually the PI of the lab in which I work, advised me to still take the class. At first I was somewhat irritated because I have to handle six classes instead of five, but now I am actually glad for this because I will finally be able to properly learn the content. (My SDS 321 professor was not the best.)</li>
<li><strong>CS 363D &amp; CS 371P.</strong> My first two CS electives!</li>
<li><strong>JPN 601D.</strong> I enrolled in a Japanese class at my community college in the summer before my junior year of high school, but it was canceled. I have had the workbook/lab manual tucked in a small space between my desk and bed ever since then, and now I get to finally use it!</li>
</ol>
<p>And here are my goals for this semester. (This is not an exhaustive list.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t skip class. Ever. </strong>I know some people who can strategically figure out which lectures and discussion sections are beneficial to them, but for me, skipping class is just a slippery slope. Once I accidentally skip one, I end up thinking that it is fine to skip more. Terrible, I know.</li>
<li><strong>Go to office hours.</strong> During my first two semester, I avoided my professors when I was not doing as well as I wanted to in their classes. Last semester I just simply did not interact with them. Hopefully this semester I can use the brains of my professors and TAs to my advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Use my planner. </strong>Last semester I just kept all due dates in my head, and I scheduled when I would start things in my head. This mostly worked except for the few times when I forgot things. Hopefully this super cute <a href="http://blog.victoria-lee.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_80181.jpg">planner</a> that I picked up at Barnes &amp; Noble for a little less than $4 (50% off all planners, 10% membership discount, and 20% coupon) will encourage me to achieve this goal.</li>
<li><strong>Start all computer science projects the day that I find out about them.</strong> I have procrastinated on almost all of my computer science projects throughout the past three semesters, and it made them all incredibly stressful and unenjoyable.</li>
<li><strong>Make it back to my apartment by midnight.</strong> Not only is it not exactly safe to be walking back to my apartment alone at ungodly hours, but I also have a new computer monitor at my apartment that will be nice to use!</li>
<li><strong>Know where I stand in my classes.</strong> Although slightly more stressful than just keeping on thinking that I can make an A in a class, knowing where I stand in my classes really helps me focus on what I need to do to get to an attainable place that I want to be. This isn’t to say that I need to pester my professors and TAs about grades all the time - just use what is available to me to know how I am doing.</li>
<li><strong>Make time for research.</strong> You get what you put in; I feel like I have not been making any significant progress on my research because I do not dedicate enough time to it.</li>
<li><strong>Allow myself to take breaks from work.</strong> (At this point, this basically means watch shows.) Don’t get me wrong; I did not spend every waking hour working on schoolwork in the past three semesters. In fact, it was probably quite the opposite during my first semester, when I chose watching shows instead of studying for finals. This past semester, I basically cut out all shows. I ended up feeling caught in an endless cycle of work, work, and more work, and I would often end up getting frustrated and spending hours until bedtime randomly surfing the Internet. The current goal is about a 45-minute episode per day with obvious exceptions when it’s crunch time.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t add any more shows to my list.</strong> I am going to keep watching the shows that are still on-going, but once those shows eventually get canceled, I am going to turn my attention to other more rewarding activities - to be revealed.</li>
<li><strong>Spend time with friends.</strong> (More milk tea?) I kind of disappeared off the face of the earth last semester, oops.</li>
<li><strong>Eat healthier.</strong> Home-cooked meals are probably a good idea for this goal as well as for my wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise.</strong> I love running, not that I’m particularly good at it or anything. I hope to one day be able to run a marathon in a decent amount of time. It is going to take a while to get to that level....</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously I really like lists. Also, I promise that not all of my posts will be about school; I am not that boring, I think.</p>

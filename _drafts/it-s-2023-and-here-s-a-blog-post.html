<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Lately, I've been feeling like a big ol contradiction.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I love my remote job, yet I miss my commutes (* used public transit!! I would not miss my commute if I had been driving). I want attention, yet I don't want to be perceived. I want to talk about my dreams, my goals; I'm afraid of failure, so I just won't do it. I want external validation; I don't need anyone's approval. I miss being in a relationship; I feel so light being by myself. I hate people (said in the most kind, introverted manner); I miss my friends. I want to blog; I don't even like writing.</p>

<p>On occasion, I have a blast just reading through my old blog entries.</p>

<p>My vice is daily vlogs on YouTube. A huge time waster of mine.</p>

excerpt: I felt so drained that I wasn't sure whether I had the energy to complete
  my application. My inner critic told me that I would never make it in, so why bother.

<p><em>I’m a rider on the 2018 Texas 4000 team, and I’ll be biking from Austin, TX to Anchorage, Alaska next summer to fight cancer. Check out my rider page <a href="http://www.texas4000.org/rider/2018/unassigned/victoria-lee/">here</a> to learn more about why I ride, and please consider making a donation if you are able to. Thank you!</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I first heard about T4K during my freshman year in college, after the recruitment process for the 2016 team had finished. I shelved the opportunity as something that I could look into later, perhaps during 2018 recruitment so that I would complete the ride right after Spring 2018 - and hopefully my graduation from UT.</p>
<p>I went along my life without giving Texas 4000 much thought at all until I spent Summer 2016 participating in MD Anderson's Cancer Prevention Research Training Program. I came back after learning and seeing so much, and I was reminded of Texas 4000 and their very meaningful cause. I decided that it was time to apply.</p>
<p>However, after a rough first round of exams in September, I felt so drained that I wasn't sure whether I had the energy to complete my application. My inner critic told me that I would never make it in, so why bother. I slowly stopped thinking about Texas 4000 yet again.</p>
<hr />
<p>One day, I was in a meeting with the director of the Engineering Career Assistance Center, VP Corporate of SWE, and my Corporate Co-Chair <a href="http://www.texas4000.org/rider/2018/unassigned/ruchika-bengani">Ruchika</a>. We were discussing some professional development event ideas when Ruchika pulled out her newly purchased planner and flipped it open. From the corner of my eye, I saw something on her to-do list: apply for Texas 4000. (I'm not nosy, I promise! I only looked because I have a huge weakness for cute stationery, and if I remember correctly, her planner had a super cute marble cover.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ruchika is super busy and still has made time to apply to something that means a lot to her; why can't I just manage my time better and just try for it as well?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>After the meeting, I looked up the application information and marked down the date of the one remaining info session. I then opened the application and read it over... and there was a line that stated that applicants could submit an optional letter of recommendation.</p>
<p>There were only 6 more days to submit the application, and there was no one who would be able to do that in such short notice.</p>
<p>And so I panicked.</p>
<p>Luckily, after voicing my concerns about the application to my boyfriend who then referred me to Kris, one of his roommates and a rider on the 2017 team, I decided to go ahead with the application even though I would not have the optional letter of recommendation.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The day of the info session rolled around. I was once again physically and mentally drained, but I forced myself to go after my 3-hour BME lab section. </span>And I'm so glad I went! To be honest, I don't remember much other than that I first met my teammate <a href="http://www.texas4000.org/rider/2018/unassigned/chai-murthy/">Chai</a> there (who I also saw later at our same group interview). I also got to see this beautiful and emotional video of the 2016 team that still gives me goosebumps every time I watch it:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOsUbMMau88</p>
<p>Then, I procrastinated a little more on the application... And I ultimately ended up completing my application on the day it was due by skipping my biomaterials lecture that Friday. (Would definitely not recommend. Don't procrastinate!)</p>
<p>I went through two interviews, finishing my last one on October 20. I didn't worry much in the mean time, as I was too busy having fun in Philly for WE16, but once I got back, I double-checked the notification date listed on the application, which stated that those who were accepted would be notified by November 1. When I received no call and no email by the end of that day, I assumed the worst.</p>
<p>The next day, I went over to my boyfriend's apartment to study and work on homework, and I crossed paths with Kris. He said something to me that I didn't process (twice), but as he walked away chuckling and saying "I guess that you'll find out in two days", I realized that he was likely referring to the result of my T4K application.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't serve to reassure me at all, and I probably spent more of my time worrying about whether or not I made the team than I did on studying for the three exams that I had from Wednesday through Friday of that week. (Oops.)</p>
<p>I finally received a call on November 4. Or more like four over the course of two hours while I was in class and wondering who in the world was blowing up my phone. I ended up picking up the phone and being somewhat snappy at the person on the other end. The person ended up being Kris.</p>
<blockquote><p>- Hi, Victoria! How are you?</p>
<p>- Uh, who is this?</p>
<p>- Kris.</p>
<p>- Kris who???</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">After hanging up the phone, I excitedly texted my boyfriend, composed more detailed messages to post on my family's GroupMe (since I hadn't told them that I was applying to the program), and notified a good friend of mine (because I thought we both needed to cheer up from the stress of school).</p>
<p>And well, here I am, one year later!</p>
